# A project in C# .Net using data from a GUI to create a report as a MS Word .doc file.

I needed to get another App to auto create me a weekly report from info it had. I found many suggestion on the web but most involved me buying add ons which while they may be good was not what I wanted. I already had MS Word and wanted to use that. I did find some help in how to do this, and this is a small APP I created to pull all the help I found together into something I could use.

Feel free to use, add to, adapt or just doodle with so the next person looking to do what I needed to has more info on how to do it.
